## generate filterbank header

                                  generate_header.c

Convert an ascii sigproc filterbank header into binary format. This can then be combined
with headerless filterbank format data. 

Compile: gcc -lm generate_header.c -o generate_header

Usage: ./generate_header ascii_header_filename

Note. the ascii header format should match the example ascii header (PM0024_02141_example.asciiheader) format precisely.

## generate DM trial list

TBD

## generate acceleration (and jerk) trial lists
                                  
                                  generate_aclist.c

Program to generate a sigproc style acceleration and jerk trial lists using the method outlined in Camilo at al., 2000, ApJ, 535, 975C (spin frequency drifts less than one spectral bin for incorrect trial), or the time domain procedure described in Eatough et al., 2013, MNRAS, 431, 292E (acceptable time domain pulse smearing of 4*t_samp for acceleration that lies exactly in between trials).

Compile:  gcc generate_aclist.c -lm -o generate_aclist

Usage: ./generate_aclist

## print Doppler modulated spin period

                                  binary_psr_periods.c

It can be useful to simulate changing pulse period seen in binary pulsars in order to establish the search parameters required to detect them - amongst other things. This program outputs the Doppler modulated spin period in addition to the line of sight velocity, acceleration and jerk for any hypothetical binary.  Currently the binary and observational parameters are hard coded to an observation of one full orbit of PSR J0737-3039A. 

Compile: gcc binary_psr_periods.c -lm -o binary_psr_periods

Usage: ./binary_psr_periods
